# Shadow Bot 2.0

The upgraded version of the ShadowBot

just to be clear, this is a french bot and if we speak in english that because u know just one language. 
So, here is the little brother of ShadowBot, born alone in the dark place of a little french server that u will never know...(his name is Shadow, don't u dare ask why).
but, by seing his big bro, abandonned, weak and mocked, he swear "I WILL BE THE KING OF THE DISCORC BOT !"(i hope u get it) and start his hard way,but with rage, to be 
harder, better, faster, stronger.

<!-- TODO : maybe write a short story about shadow bot 1.0 and his brother ? -->
